  >> Thermo-kinetic modeling of the wet phase inversion process for polymeric membranes fabrication, with [Dr. Mohammad Ali Aroon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IxP_tLUAAAAJ&hl=en)
  >
  > **Project Goal**
  >> Developed a **comprehensive thermo-kinetic model** to simulate the wet phase inversion process for fabricating polymeric membranes, focusing on Multiphysics coupling and accurate prediction of **polymeric flat-sheet membrane structure evolution**.     
  > 
  > **Tasks Performed**   
  >> - Constructed and solved **coupled heat, mass, and momentum transport models under non-equilibrium thermodynamics**, incorporating **moving boundary conditions in multiphase, multicomponent porous systems**.
  >> - Formulated and implemented **partial and ordinary differential equation solvers (PDE/ODE)** to capture the transient dynamics of solvent-nonsolvent exchange and polymer precipitation.
  >> - Wrote custom **code in Fortran, MATLAB, and C++** for high-fidelity numerical simulations and sensitivity analyses.
  >> - **Validated computational results against experimental measurements**, achieving strong agreement in membrane morphology predictions.
  >> - Gained insight into phase separation kinetics, diffusion mechanisms, and the impact of process parameters on membrane performance and structure.
