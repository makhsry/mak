  > **Tasks Performed**       
  >> - **Designed**, **simulated**, and **optimized** a separation process in **Aspen HYSYS**, achieving efficient separation of ethane and methane under various operating conditions.                   
  >> - Developed comprehensive **Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs)** to visualize and document the system configuration, **material and energy balances**, and process controls.              
  >> - Performed **equipment sizing and selection** for distillation columns, heat exchangers, compressors, and separators based on simulated process data and vendor specifications.            
  >> - Conducted **cost analysis**, including **capital expenditure (CAPEX)**, **operating expenditure (OPEX)**, and utility consumption, to assess **economic feasibility** and guide procurement strategies.               
  >> - Applied **exergy analysis** and **pinch analysis** to identify thermodynamic inefficiencies and optimize energy integration, improving process sustainability and reducing waste heat.                     
  >> - Evaluated and compared equipment procurement options using technical and economic criteria to support decision-making for pilot-scale implementation.
