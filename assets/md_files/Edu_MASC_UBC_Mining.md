  > **Project Goal**
  >> **Retrofitting of conventional drying unit operations** at a local industrial mining partner.
  >      
  > **Project Summary**
  >> Inspected and evaluated, experimentally and numerically (via Finite Element Modeling in COMSOL), the **feasibility and applicability** of microwave-based heating systems at a local **mining industrial partner** for the **retrofitting of conventional drying unit operations**.
  > 
  > **Tasks Performed**     
  >> - Performed experimental and numerical analysis of **mineral drying behavior under microwave exposure**. 
  >> - Utilized **finite element modeling** (FEM) to simulate heat and mass transfer during drying at various microwave power levels and **mineral types**. 
  >> - Conducted comprehensive **energy demand analysis** to evaluate **potential savings** compared to traditional kiln operations.
