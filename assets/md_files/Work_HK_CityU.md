  >> Design of Adorptive Systems for Direct Gas Capture and Separation, with [Dr. Jin Shang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AWnBD4kAAAAJ).    
  >
  > **Project Goal**
  >> Developed a novel process for the direct capture, separation, and solid-state storage of nitrogen (N₂) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) gases under ambient conditions using moist lithium as a reactive adsorbent, with an emphasis on circular material recovery for sustainable gas handling and sequestration.

  > **Tasks Performed**       
  >> - Designed and optimized gas capture protocols for ambient-condition adsorption of N₂ and CO₂ on moist lithium, enabling safe and efficient conversion into solid-state Li₃N for storage and transport.                    
  >> - Applied principles of **reaction engineering** and separation to evaluate process efficiency, yield, and purity of captured products.                 
  >> - Conducted Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to map **reaction pathways** between lithium and target gases, identifying favorable thermodynamic and kinetic conditions.                 
  >> - Developed microkinetic and kinetic Monte Carlo models to simulate **reaction dynamics** and **upscale lab-scale findings for process-scale feasibility**.             
  >> - Demonstrated **on-demand recovery** of nitrogen and lithium through electrochemical regeneration, showcasing **material circularity** and long-term process sustainability.
