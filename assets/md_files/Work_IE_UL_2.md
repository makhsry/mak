  > **Project**    
  >> Continueous Cocrystalization via Hot Melt Extrusion in Phamaceuticals, with [Dr. Gavin Walker](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h4O37BYAAAAJ&hl=en).    
  >
  > **Project Goal**
  >> Developed a **data-driven digital twin framework** to address low-yield challenges in continuous crystallization, aiming to enhance product quality, optimize production, and reduce waste and operational costs in pharmaceutical manufacturing.                       
  > 
  > **Tasks Performed**       
  >> - Conducted detailed **root-cause analysis** of unit operations to identify inefficiencies affecting yield and product purity in **continuous crystallization systems**.                         
  >> - Evaluated the influence of **critical process parameters**—temperature, residence time, screw configuration, and rotation speed—on crystallization outcomes, using both experimental data and simulation insights.                    
  >> - Designed and refined **process strategies*** to maximize desired product formation, suppress by-product generation, and reduce procurement and disposal costs.                      
  >> - Built a digital twin using advanced **data analytics** and implemented a **machine learning-based process controller**, integrating both real-time (in-line) & historical (offline) **sensor data streams**-Raman spectroscopy.                
  >> - Utilized Density Functional Theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to analyze **molecular interactions**, guiding optimal cocrystal formation **pathways** and identifying **key process descriptors**.                  
  >> - Integrated **Raman spectrometer** data into a live control system, enabling real-time feedback and control within a continuous manufacturing environment through predictive ML models.
