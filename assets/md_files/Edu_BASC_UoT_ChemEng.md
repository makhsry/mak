  >> Simulation and cost evaluation of hot section of BIPC olefin plant, with [Dr. Nasim Tahouni](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jWEhjFcAAAAJ&hl=en)
  >
  > **Project Goal**
  >> Used **Aspen Hysys** and **Aspen Plus** to evaluate **retrofitting** of industrial scale **petroleum refinery** complex by producing process flow diagram (**PFD**), piping/process & instrumentation diagram (**P&ID**), **cost** and **utility**, pinch and exergy.      
  > 
  > **Tasks Performed**       
  >> - Simulated existing and proposed **process configurations using Aspen HYSYS and Aspen Plus**, focusing on optimizing reactor and separation systems for olefin recovery.      
  >> - Developed and **documented detailed Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs)** to map unit operations, control loops, and equipment connectivity.
  >> - Performed **equipment sizing and specification** for heat exchangers, reactors, compressors, and distillation columns based on simulated operating conditions.
  >> - Conducted **cost estimation and utility analysis** (CAPEX and OPEX) to support retrofitting and procurement decisions.
  >> - Applied **pinch analysis and exergy analysis** to evaluate and enhance energy integration and thermodynamic efficiency across the system.
  >> - Assessed **retrofitting feasibility** by integrating performance data, economic viability, and process safety considerations.
