  > **Project**    
  >> Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Materials Discovery, with [Dr. Alexander Shapeev](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=NMyIbIwAAAAJ).     
  >
  > **Project Goal**
  >> Aimed to **expedite the discovery and characterization** of hard materials for use in high-performance environments—such as aerospace, automotive, mining, and manufacturing—by developing and deploying **ML-driven interatomic potentials** for predictive modeling.  
  > 
  > **Tasks Performed**       
  >> - Assessed candidate **hard materials** for industrial applications, focusing on performance under mechanical stress and durability in **extreme conditions**.      
  >> - Conducted **nanoindentation** research to evaluate **mechanical properties** such as hardness and elastic modulus of synthesized materials.        
  >> - Developed validation models to discuss experimental results with simulation predictions, extracting insights into **material failure** modes and defect behavior.       
  >> - Implemented and trained **Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials** (MLIPs) using active learning strategies to improve accuracy with minimal data.       
  >> - **Automated** molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using LAMMPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations using VASP for large-scale material screening **across multiple HPC clusters**.        
  >> - Wrote modular and efficient code in Python and Bash, managing environments and version control using Git.
