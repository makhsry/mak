
This is a python based script that takes in a drawing and project it onto a rough rout onto map of the designated city. 

It is based on decouling colors and edges of the pathes. Also, to perform projection, a border line must be added to the outer extend of the drawing to enable the proper overlaying. 

The output is a .gpx file that can be imported to any app processing gpx file. 

An Androind, TypeScript and iOS version in under finalization with more improved procedures, and will be shared here in near future.
