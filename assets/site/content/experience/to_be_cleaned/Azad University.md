## Research Collaborator, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran (2014 Sept. - 2017 Sept.)

under [Young Researchers and Elite Club](https://yrec.ac.ir/en).

**Tasks Performed**       

- Managed **diverse portfolios of research and development projects**, ensuring timely delivery, quality outputs, and **cross-disciplinary collaboration**.                    
- Authored technical proposals, project schedules, and successfully acquired research funding for innovative environmental and industrial process solutions.                         
- Directed maintaining high performance across the lifecycle of **multiple concurrent projects**.                           

**Sample Projects**        

- On-site detection and monitoring of pollutants in **water and wastewater** streams via polymeric passive samplers.                       
- Translated dilation to **attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR)** of polycarbonate, poly (vinyl acetate), and poly (ether urethane) induced by acetonitrile.                        
- Removal mechanism of **heavy metal ions** (Pb, Cu, Cd, Zn, and Ni) by using lignin as adsorbent.                     
- **Direct air capture and storage** of carbon dioxide (CO2) on biomass and polymers at ambient conditions trough novel 'CO2–water–biomass' network enabling adsorption of 5–56 grams of CO2 per gram of biomass.                           
- Developed a detailed coated paper **process model** including convection, conduction, and radiation heat transfer in order to pave routes for optimization of industrial process through adjustments made to the air humidity, belt velocity, temperatures, as well as the distance between drying surface and the radiation heat source.                              
- **Supercritical fluid extraction and purification** of high end-value products (drugs and dyes) via supercritical carbon dioxide.
