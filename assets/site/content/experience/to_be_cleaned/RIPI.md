**Project**    

Design of Separation Systems for Ethane and Methane, with [Dr. Nasim Tahouni](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jWEhjFcAAAAJ&hl=en).                  

**Project Goal**

Completed a process engineering internship focused on the **simulation and optimization** of a gas separation unit targeting high-purity ethane and methane recovery, integrating both **technical design** and **economic analysis** using industry-standard tools..                                                 

**Tasks Performed**       

- **Designed**, **simulated**, and **optimized** a separation process in **Aspen HYSYS**, achieving efficient separation of ethane and methane under various operating conditions.                   
- Developed comprehensive **Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs)** to visualize and document the system configuration, **material and energy balances**, and process controls.              
- Performed **equipment sizing and selection** for distillation columns, heat exchangers, compressors, and separators based on simulated process data and vendor specifications.            
- Conducted **cost analysis**, including **capital expenditure (CAPEX)**, **operating expenditure (OPEX)**, and utility consumption, to assess **economic feasibility** and guide procurement strategies.               
- Applied **exergy analysis** and **pinch analysis** to identify thermodynamic inefficiencies and optimize energy integration, improving process sustainability and reducing waste heat.                     
- Evaluated and compared equipment procurement options using technical and economic criteria to support decision-making for pilot-scale implementation.
