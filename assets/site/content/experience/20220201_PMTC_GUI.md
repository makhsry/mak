**Project**     

Fluid Bed Spray Dryer Process Monitoring and Engineering, with [Dr. Marcus O'Mahony](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zrrZoBkAAAAJ&hl=en).         

**Project Goal**     

Designed and implemented a **data-driven graphical user interface** for real-time **monitoring** and **optimization** of a fluid bed spray drying process by integrating in-line/offline sensor data streams and advanced analytics into an interactive platform.  

**Tasks Performed**     

- Developed an interactive **graphical user interface (GUI) in MATLAB** for real-time data **visualization** and **diagnostics**, supporting both in-line and offline sensor data integration.                     
- Integrated and processed **diverse sensor types** including CCD camera feeds (image-based analysis), NIR sensors (unlabeled time-series), Raman spectroscopy probes (localized unstructured signals), and valve states (binary control signals).                      
- Performed extensive data preprocessing and cleansing to handle **high-dimensional and heterogeneous datasets** with missing values and sensor noise.                    
- Applied **pattern recognition** and signal analysis techniques to identify operational trends, detect anomalies, and support process optimization.                
- Designed pipelines for real-time data ingestion and synchronization from multiple sensor sources, ensuring temporal alignment and reliable analytics under dynamic plant conditions.                  
- Collaborated with process engineers and control specialists to translate sensor insights into actionable process improvements and control strategies.
