**Project**    

Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Materials Discovery, with [Dr. Alexander Shapeev](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=NMyIbIwAAAAJ).     

**Project Goal**        

Aimed to **expedite the discovery and characterization** of hard materials for use in high-performance environments—such as aerospace, automotive, mining, and manufacturing—by developing and deploying **ML-driven interatomic potentials** for predictive modeling.  

**Tasks Performed**     

- Assessed candidate **hard materials** for industrial applications, focusing on performance under mechanical stress and durability in **extreme conditions**.      
- Conducted **nanoindentation** research to evaluate **mechanical properties** such as hardness and elastic modulus of synthesized materials.        
- Developed validation models to discuss experimental results with simulation predictions, extracting insights into **material failure** modes and defect behavior.       
- Implemented and trained **Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials** (MLIPs) using active learning strategies to improve accuracy with minimal data.       
- Automated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using LAMMPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations using VASP for large-scale material screening **across multiple HPC clusters**.      
- Wrote modular and efficient code in Python and Bash, managing environments and version control using Git.
