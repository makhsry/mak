**Tasks Performed**     

- Skilled in modeling and optimizing **industrial chemical processes**, with a focus on simulating chemical reactors, emphasizing heterogeneous systems in **Aspen** environments.                      
- Applied **optimization techniques** within Aspen platforms to enhance **process performance** and **efficiency**.                    
- Designed and simulated **crude oil distillation processes** using Aspen HYSYS.                        
- Implemented **dynamic simulation** and **control** strategies to model **real-time** process behavior in HYSYS.                     
- Created **process flowsheets** for specialty chemicals and reactions using Aspen.                
- Wrote/modified **FORTRAN subroutines** in Aspen for ad-hoc units / calculations.
