## Process Engineer: Gas Separation and Capture (Research Assistant), City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong (2017 Nov. - 2018 May) 

**Project**    

Design of Adorptive Systems for Direct Gas Capture and Separation, with [Dr. Jin Shang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AWnBD4kAAAAJ).    

**Project Goal**

Developed a novel process for the direct capture, separation, and solid-state storage of nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases under ambient conditions using moist lithium as a reactive adsorbent, with an emphasis on circular material recovery for sustainable gas handling and sequestration.                       

**Tasks Performed**       

- Designed and optimized gas capture protocols for ambient-condition adsorption of nitrogen and carbon dioxide on moist lithium, enabling safe and efficient conversion into solid-state lithium nitride for storage and transport.                    
- Applied principles of **reaction engineering** and separation to evaluate process efficiency, yield, and purity of captured products.                 
- Conducted Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to map **reaction pathways** between lithium and target gases, identifying favorable thermodynamic and kinetic conditions.                 
- Developed microkinetic and kinetic Monte Carlo models to simulate **reaction dynamics** and **upscale lab-scale findings for process-scale feasibility**.             
- Demonstrated **on-demand recovery** of nitrogen and lithium through electrochemical regeneration, showcasing **material circularity** and long-term process sustainability.
