## Mineral Process Engineer
         
**Workplace**

[UBC Norman B. Keevil Institute of Mining Engineering](https://mining.ubc.ca/), Vancouver, Canada.

**Timeline**

2023 Jan. - 2025 Dec.

**Project**

Microwave Assisted Drying of Minerals, with [Dr. Ali G. Madiseh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=37lpUjsAAAAJ&hl=en).        
                    
**Project Goal**

Collaborated with a local **mining company**, under [Mitacs Accelerate Internship](https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/accelerate/), to electrify kiln **drying processes** by integrating microwave-based heating systems aimed at **reducing fossil fuel dependence** (12.25 million cubic meters of natural gas), **lowering economic expenses** (e.g., $2.08 million carbon tax), and **minimizing greenhouse gas emissions** (e.g., 26,000 tons of CO2e annually).                 
      
**Tasks Performed**

- Measured and analyzed **thermophysical** and **electromagnetic** properties of minerals subjected to **microwave heating**, providing essential data for **system design** and **process optimization**.              
- Developed and validated **Finite Element Models (FEM)** of **coupled electromagnetic heating** in **COMSOL** Multiphysics to guide the design and construction of a **continuous on-site drying line**.             
- Successfully compiled COMSOL Multiphysics on UBC Sockeye HPC systems, ensuring proper file access, MPI fork setup, and security configurations to facilitate large-scale simulations.                     
- Formulated **atomistic and molecular modeling protocols** to predict the electromagnetic properties of multicomponent materials under alternating current (AC), enhancing material design for efficient microwave heating.                 
- Performed **Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations** and developed **custom Machine Learning (ML) interatomic potentials** for molecular dynamics simulations; modified **LAMMPS source code (C++)** for high-fidelity simulations of material behaviors under microwave exposure.              
- Created Bash and Python scripts for post-processing of simulation results, **data visualization**, and **executive analytics** to support project planning, delivery, and presentations to stakeholders.
