## Marie Sklodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow                        

**Workplace**

[Synthesis and Solid State Pharmaceutical Centre (SSPC)](https://sspc.ie/), [Bernal Institute](https://bernal.ul.ie/), [University of Limerick](https://www.ul.ie/), Ireland

**Timeline**

2019: Oct. - 2022: Feb.

**Project**    

Continueous Cocrystalization via Hot Melt Extrusion in Phamaceuticals, with [Dr. Gavin Walker](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h4O37BYAAAAJ&hl=en).    

**Project Goal**

Developed a **data-driven digital twin framework** to address low-yield challenges in continuous crystallization, aiming to enhance product quality, optimize production, and reduce waste and operational costs in pharmaceutical manufacturing.                       

**Tasks Performed**       

- Conducted detailed **root-cause analysis** of unit operations to identify inefficiencies affecting yield and product purity in **continuous crystallization systems**.   
- Evaluated the influence of **critical process parameters**—temperature, residence time, screw configuration, and rotation speed—on crystallization outcomes, using both experimental data and simulation insights.     
- Designed and refined **process strategies*** to maximize desired product formation, suppress by-product generation, and reduce procurement and disposal costs.            
- Built a digital twin using advanced **data analytics** and implemented a **machine learning-based process controller**, integrating both real-time (in-line) & historical (offline) **sensor data streams**-Raman spectroscopy.     
- Utilized Density Functional Theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to analyze **molecular interactions**, guiding optimal cocrystal formation **pathways** and identifying **key process descriptors**.    
- Integrated **Raman spectrometer** data into a live control system, enabling real-time feedback and control within a continuous manufacturing environment through predictive ML models.
