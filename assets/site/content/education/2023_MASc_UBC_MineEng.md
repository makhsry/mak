**Project**

Microwave assisted drying of minerals, with [Dr. Ali G. Madiseh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=37lpUjsAAAAJ&hl=en).

**Project Goal**

Retrofitting of conventional drying unit operations at a local industrial mining partner.
      
**Project Summary**

Inspected and evaluated, experimentally and numerically (via Finite Element Modeling in COMSOL), the **feasibility and applicability** of microwave-based heating systems at a local **mining industrial partner** for the **retrofitting of conventional drying unit operations**.

**Tasks Performed**

- Performed experimental and numerical analysis of **mineral drying behavior under microwave exposure**. 
- Utilized **finite element modeling** (FEM) to simulate heat and mass transfer during drying at various microwave power levels and **mineral types**. 
- Conducted comprehensive **energy demand analysis** to evaluate **potential savings** compared to traditional kiln operations.
