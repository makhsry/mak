Proprietary (No License)

**Effect**: The creator retains all exclusive rights to the source code under copyright law.

**Usage**: Other users may view and fork the repository on GitHub (per the Terms of Service for site functionality), but they are not granted permission to use, modify, or distribute the code for any purpose.

**Enforcement**: While the code is publicly visible, a lack of an explicit license means that any use by a third party (outside of viewing/forking on GitHub as per TOS) would be a copyright infringement, which the owner would have to enforce legally.
